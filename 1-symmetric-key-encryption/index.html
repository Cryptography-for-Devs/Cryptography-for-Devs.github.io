        <h1><span style="color: #ccc;">1. </span>Symmetric key encryption</h1>

        <h2>ðŸ“œ The story of Scytales</h2>

        <p>In the ancient days, cryptography started off as a way to protect valuable messages from enemy access.
            Ancient
            emperors used various methods to convey secret military messages to their army commanders.</p>

        <p>One of the earliest methods include the use of a cylindrical wooden rod called <strong>Scytale</strong> used
            by
            ancient Greek emperors. Before a military invasion, the emperor would order to make two exactly same
            cylindrical
            wooden rods (scytales). The king would give one scytale to the army commander and keep one with himself.</p>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Skytale.png" alt="Scytale">
            <figcaption>
                A scytale
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The way it worked was, the emperor would wound a strip of leather across the scytale and then write the
            message.
        </p>

        <p>Suppose a specific scytale allowed one to write three letters around in a circle and five letters down the
            side
            of
            it. The wounded leather strip with the message &quot;attackfromright&quot; written on it will look like:</p>

        <pre>
       |   |   |   |   |   |
       | a | t | t | a | c |  |
     __| k | f | r | o | m |__|
    |  | r | i | g | h | t |
    |  |   |   |   |   |   |
        </pre>

        <p>After writing the message with scytale, the emperor will un-wound the leather strip and send it
            to
            the
            commandar.</p>

        <p>The un-wounded strip will contain the message:</p>

        <pre>
----------------
akrtfitrgaohcmt
----------------
</pre>

        <p>Now, even if the leather strip gets intercepted by an enemy spy, the message will not make sense. Isn&#39;t
            this
            fascinating? smart use of a wooden rod might have helped the ancient emperors win battles.</p>

        <h2>Symmetric key encryption</h2>

        <p>The scytale technique we saw above was an encryption technique. Encryption is a process in which the original
            message
            is modified (or encoded) in such a way that only the intended receipient can decode to see the actual
            message.
        </p>

        <p>The original message is called <strong>plaintext</strong>, the encoded message is called the
            <strong>ciphertext</strong>. Encryption converts <code>plaintext to ciphertext</code> with help of a
            <strong>key</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>To decrypt, that is to convert <code>ciphertext to plaintext</code>, it can only be done by those who have
            access to
            that
            same <strong>key</strong>.</p>

        <p>If we compare it to the scytale technique, the scytale (the wooden rod) is the key and is only shared
            with
            the
            commander. Here&#39;s how the encryption process looks like:</p>

            <figcaption>Encryption process with scytale. Click to zoom.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The decryption process will look like:</p>

        <figure>

            <figcaption>Decryption process with scytale. Click to zoom.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>We call this symmetric key encryption because the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. Later
            in
            the
            course, we will see asymmetric key encryption, in which two different keys will used, one for encryption and
            another
            for decryption.</p>

        <h2>Breaking the encryption</h2>

        <p>In case of scytale, imagine, if a very motivated enemy spy gets access to the leather strip that has the
            ciphertext
            on it. What&#39;s stopping the enemy spy in decrypting the ciphertext? there are two hurdles for the enemy
            spy
            --
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>The encryption and decryption technique (or the algorithm):</strong> the Greek emperor
                    wounded
                    the
                    leather strip across the scytale and then wrote the message to generate the ciphertext. And the
                    commander
                    had to do the same thing, that is, wound the strip around scytale and then read the plaintext. This
                    technique of writing and reading with help of scytale were unknown to the enemy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>The scytale itself (or the key):</strong> the scytale that only the emperor and the commander
                    shared
                    were
                    of a particular dimension. If the enemy spy manages to create the exact same scytale then they just
                    needed
                    to know how to use the scytale to decrypt the ciphertext.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable
                src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Battle_scene_from_the_Greek_War_of_Independence.jpg"
                alt="Greek war">
            <figcaption>A Greek war</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Let&#39;s hear a story. The Greek emperor is fighting a battle. They lose the battle and the enemy tortures
            the
            commandar to reveal the scytale and how he used the scytale to read the ciphertext. Now, their scytale (key)
            &amp;
            the method of reading (algorithm) both are revealed. The enemy shares both of this intel to the other
            enemies of
            the
            emperor.</p>

        <p>Now, the emperor is in trouble because all of his enemies knows his communication algorithm and the key. How
            can
            the
            emperor deal with this situation?</p>

        <p>The emperor was clever. He changed the scytale for future wars. Now even if the enemy gets access to the
            ciphertext,
            they will need to make the exact same scytale to decrypt the ciphertext.</p>

        <p>Suppose the scytale was of 50cm in length and 10cm in diameter and this scytale allowed to write three
            letters
            around
            in a circle and five letters across the length. If the enemy makes a scytale of any other dimension then the
            enemy
            won&#39;t be able to read the ciphertext correctly because the exact number of letters should fit around
            circle
            and
            across the length of scytale to accurately decrypt the ciphertext.</p>

        <p>The enemy will need to make hundreds of different stycales to figure out the right one. That is, the enemy
            will
            need
            to <strong>brute-force</strong> the key.</p>

        <p>But making hundreds of them can take weeks because there are no machines, it'll all be done by human
            craftsman. Till the time enemy figures out the right scytale, the emperor
            crushes
            the enemy&#39;s army and wins the battle. Yeah, emperor for the win!</p>

        <p>With time and experience, it was realised that keeping the encryption algorithm as an internal secret is not
            feasible. The encryption algorithm is bound to get revealed not immeditely but definitely over the course of
            time.
        </p>

        <p>Even if the key gets revealed, the key can easily be updated but designing a new encryption algorithm
            everytime
            it
            gets revealed is not at all feasible.</p>

        <p>Auguste Kerckhoffs and later Claude Shannon, the pioneers of Cryptography stated one of the most
            important
            principles
            of Cryptography called the <strong>Kerckhoffs's principle</strong>. It says that -- it should always be
            assumed that the
            <strong>enemy knows everything about the encryption
                algorithm (and the system)</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>The security of a particular encryption algorithm depends only on how hard it is to crack the key. The more
            variations
            the
            key can have, the harder it'll be to crack it.</p>

        <p>So, it&#39;s all in the key! The key should be kept secret from adversaries. It should only be shared with
            the trusted parties.</p>
