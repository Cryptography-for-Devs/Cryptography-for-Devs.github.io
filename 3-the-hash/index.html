        <h1><span style="color: #ccc;">3. </span>#️⃣ Cryptographic hash functions</h1>

        <h2>Hash functions</h2>

        <p>You might have heard about hash functions that are used in hash tables. The hash functions were initially
            made in
            the 1950s for faster data lookups.</p>


        <figure>
            <img src="hash-functions.svg" data-zoomable alt="non-cryptographic hash function">
            <figcaption>A hash table</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>A hash function takes in an input and produces an output called <strong>hash</strong> that serves as a
            shortcut
            to access the input data much faster next time we need it.</p>

        <p>Hash tables are like an index of a book, we can look at the index to find the page number for a chapter and
            quickly go to that chapter, we don't need to go through every page.</p>

        <p>From the above image, if we want to search for a user named "Orange butter". We pass the string "Orange
            butter" as input to the same hash function we used earlier when we created the hash table. We get 15 as
            output
            (the hash value).</p>

        <pre>
        "Orange butter"  --->  [ Hash function ] ---> 15
    </pre>


        <p>Now, we can access the 15th index of the hash table in constant time <code>O(1)</code> because hash table's
            indexes (also called buckets) are an array. We didn't need to go through all the users in sequence or in a
            binary search fashion. Hash table lookups
            are <code>O(1)</code>. Super fast.</p>

        <p>That's about hash functions used for hash table's purposes.</p>

        <p>As time passed, transistors came along and computers started reaching consumer's hands. People started
            sharing
            software programs and files over network and floppy disks.</p>

        <p>Programmers realised that
            they needed some way to verify if a file's contents are not tampered with. That is, to verify whether the
            bits
            of
            a file are not modified by any third-party. This is called file <strong>integrity</strong> check -- whether
            the
            bits of a file are accurately integrated.</p>

        <p>This need for integrity checks led to the widespread development of <strong>cryptographic hash
                functions</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Cryptographic hash functions</h2>

        <p>Cryptographic hash functions share similar spirit with the non-cryptographic hash function we discussed
            above,
            but the cryptographic hash functions are designed with totally different objectives in mind so their
            internal
            design and implementation are different from the non-cryptographic ones.</p>


        <p>Cryptographic hash functions given an input produces a fixed-length hash.</p>

        <p>In the below code editor, try running the code. Change the input a little bit
            and
            try running it again. You will observe that even a smallest change like a space generates an entirely
            different
            hash.</p>

        <div id="editor-container">
            <div id="editor"></div>
        </div>
        <button id="run-btn">Run</button>
        <div id="console-output" style="word-break: break-all;"></div>
        <script>
            const initialCode = `console.log(CryptoJS.SHA1("Cryptography for developers!"));`;

            const editor = CodeMirror(document.getElementById('editor'), {
                mode: 'javascript',
                lineNumbers: true,
                value: initialCode
            });

            const consoleOutput = document.getElementById('console-output');
            const runBtn = document.getElementById('run-btn');

            // Override console.log
            const originalLog = console.log;
            console.log = function (...args) {
                originalLog.apply(console, args);
                consoleOutput.textContent = args.join(' ');
            };

            runBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
                consoleOutput.textContent = ''; // Clear previous output
                try {
                    eval(editor.getValue());
                } catch (error) {
                    console.log('Error:', error.message);
                }
            });
        </script>


        <p>Every cryptographic hash function
            must
            have the below three properties --</p>

        <ul>
            <li>They must be <b>deterministic</b>, which means they must return the same hash value when the same input
                is
                passed to the hash function.</li>
            <li>It must be impossible to take the hash and figure out the input from the hash. Cryptographic hash
                functions are a <b>one-way function</b>. There must be no way at all to turn the hash value back to the
                input.
            </li>

            <li>For almost every input there should be a unique hash, no two differing input should share the same hash.
                If two
                input
                share the same hash, it's called a <b>hash collision</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable src="hash-collision.svg"
                alt="hash collision illustration">
            <figcaption>A hash collision</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>If a hash collision is detected in a cryptographic hash
            function, then that cryptographic hash function is meant to be insecure. For example, a popular
            cryptographic hash function SHA-1 <a
                href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2017/02/23/the-end-of-sha-1-on-the-public-web/"
                target="_blank">suffered a hash collision on 2017</a> that retired its use on web browsers.</p>

        <p>Currently, SHA-256 and SHA-512 are cryptographically secure. Let us understand the 256 and 512 in these SHAs.
        </p>

        <pre>
        The SHA-256 will produce a hash of 256 bits (32 bytes). 
        The 256 in SHA denotes the hash output size (or also called hash length) in bits.

        Similarly, the SHA-512 will produce a hash of 512 bits (64 bytes). 

        -----------------------------------------------------------------------

        SHA-256("curious cryptography") = 
        b9b6062f154f139f5bd54b36a1eaf5c2182ed9521c8225c59f60bbd5127f9671

        The above hash output is in hexadecimal format.
        We can't use the UTF-8 encoding because hash output bytes are random, 
        they won't necessarily map to a UTF-8 character, so trying to encode
        to UTF-8 will error out.
        That's why, the hash outputs are always shown in hexadecimal!
        
        If you count the number of hex characters in the above hash, 
        its 64 characters.
        One hexadecimal character occupies 4 bits, and total hash size is 256 bits.
        So, number of hex characters in SHA-256 should be 256 / 4 = 64 hexadecimal characters.
        </pre>

        <p>You might wonder, <strong>why hash collisions make a cryptographic hash function insecure?</strong> To
            understand that we
            need
            to talk about real world use cases of
            cryptographic hash functions.</p>

        <h2>Real world uses of cryptographic hash functions</h2>

        <h3>Git commits and objects</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="git-log-hash.png" data-zoomable alt="git log hash">
            <figcaption>git log of one of my repo's</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Git extensively used SHA-1 hash function. When we make a <code>git commit</code>, git collects information
            about
            the current directory's files, current timestamp and author details, it passes all this data to a SHA-1 hash
            function, which produces a commit hash like <code>27f0f577ce740bc302eb8bf55faf293c15a2131c</code>.</p>
        <p>Now imagine, if an attacker somehow manages to edit files in a particular fashion that creates a commit hash
            which
            already exists in the repo (a hash collision), other developers might unknowingly pull and run the malicious
            code, thinking it's a legitimate version.</p>

        <p>The above situation is quite imaginary because a malicious code cannot be directly committed by an outsider,
            it
            needs to be
            accepted & merged by your team via a pull request. But, you get the idea why it's bad if somehow someone
            manages
            to
            produce a hash
            collision.</p>
        <p>Don't worry, Git has <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/hash-function-transition" target="_blank">decided to
                migrate to a more cryptographically secure hash function</a>.</p>

        <h3>Package's integrity</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="file-integrity.svg" data-zoomable alt="file integrity illustration">
            <figcaption>Package integrity process</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>As we already hinted above, integrity is one of the major use cases for cryptographic hash functions. In the
            Ubuntu
            package distribution system, there are several mirrors of the package archive. Mirrors are created off the
            main
            archive to serve local geography. For example, MIT has its own mirror of the Ubuntu package archive, so MIT
            students
            can download Ubuntu packages very quickly without querying the far away main archive.</p>
        <p>The main Ubuntu archive publishes hash values of their packages called <strong>checksums</strong>. Checksum
            is
            another name for
            the
            hash value. When packages are downloaded via <code>apt</code> from a mirror, a checksum is generated by
            passing
            the
            downloaded package
            to
            the same hash function that was used on the main Ubuntu archive. If the checksum matches to that of the main
            Ubuntu
            archive, it means the downloaded package's content is exactly the same as that of the main Ubuntu site. So,
            it
            can
            be safely installed and run.</p>
        <p>Imagine if a bad actor creates a mirror, uploads a modified package 😈 that produces the same hash <b>(a hash
                collision)</b> as the main Ubuntu
            archive's package. Then when you install that package, <code>apt</code> is not going to complain since the
            hash
            of the downloaded package and that of the main Ubuntu archive are same, <code>apt</code> thinks that the
            downloaded package's content and that of main Ubuntu archive are same as well.</p>

        <p>So, hash collisions are the biggest enemy for a cryptographic hash function. In the case of non-cryptographic
            hash
            functions that we use with hash tables, if a hash collision occurs, it's not that big of a deal; the hash
            collision
            is just going to affect the performance of the lookup. But for cryptographic hash functions, hash collisions
            are
            intolerable.</p>
