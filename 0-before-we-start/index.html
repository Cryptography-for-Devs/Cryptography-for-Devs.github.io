        <h1>Before we start</h1>

        <p>Before we move forward, you need to promise me that -- you will <strong>never ever implement
                your own cryptographic algorithm in production.</strong> You just need to use your framework or language
            provided libraries.</p>


        <p>Then why should you spend time on this course?</p>

        <p>
            You will understand the reason behind why certain techniques are used and their underlying concepts. So, if
            you are curious for that, let us get started!
        </p>

            We believe this can be made a timeless resource for developers to learn about
            cryptography concepts only if we get your feedback to iterate and improve the content.
