In regular programming courses, cryptography concepts are overlooked. In my initial days as a developer I saw various terms like -- `PBKDF-2, salt, key pairs, hashing`. I never really understood what do they mean deeply.

5 years back, I got a chance to help freeCodeCamp in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/pull/184">creating a short course on public key cryptography</a> aimed at web developers.

That course gave me a chance to dive deep into these cryptography concepts.

So, I created this free course to share my learnings with all the developers curious to understand the <strong>cryptography concepts that are relevant to daily developer life.</strong>

## Course contents

I have tried covering developer-oriented cryptography concepts in an easy to follow manner.

<ol start="0">
    <li><a href="https://cryptography-for-devs.github.io/0-before-we-start/" target="_blank">Before we start (Do not skip this)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cryptography-for-devs.github.io/1-symmetric-key-encryption/" target="_blank">Symmetric key encryption</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cryptography-for-devs.github.io/2-caesar-challenge/" target="_blank">Code challenge: Caesar's cipher</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cryptography-for-devs.github.io/3-the-hash/" target="_blank">Cryptographic hash functions</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cryptography-for-devs.github.io/4-revealed-passwords/" target="_blank">Password hashing</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cryptography-for-devs.github.io/5-rainbows-and-salts/" target="_blank">Rainbow table and the salt</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cryptography-for-devs.github.io/6-slow-them-down/" target="_blank">PBKDF-2: slowing down</a></li>


If the first half proves valuable to lots of developers, then I will work hard on the second half based on developers' feedback. 

All of this will remain free, forever! <a href="https://twitter.com/vkwebdev" target="_blank">You can follow me on Twitter</a>, there you will receive updates on future releases and my future projects.

## Contributing

There are two ways to contribute that I feel are going to be impactful:

- Improve the existing course content by submitting a PR.
- Create an issue and introduce yourself in that issue, if you would like to help me write one of the future lessons.
