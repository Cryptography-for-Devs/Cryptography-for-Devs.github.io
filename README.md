# Cryptography for Developers

![readme cover](readme-cover.png)

In regular programming courses, cryptography concepts are overlooked. In my initial days as a developer I saw various terms like -- `PBKDF-2, salt, key pairs, hashing`. I never really understood what do they mean deeply.

5 years back, I got a chance to help freeCodeCamp in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/pull/184">creating a short course on public key cryptography</a> aimed at web developers.

That course gave me a chance to dive deep into these cryptography concepts.

So, I created this free course to share my learnings with all the developers curious to understand the cryptography concepts that are relevant to their daily developer life.

## Course contents

I have tried covering developer-oriented cryptography concepts in an easy to follow manner.

The second half of the course around asymmetric cryptography is not yet released. If the first half proves valuable to lots of developers, then I will work hard on the second half based on developers' feedback. All of it will remain free, forever :D
