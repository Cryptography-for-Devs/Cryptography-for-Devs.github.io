In regular programming courses, cryptography concepts are overlooked. In my initial days as a developer I saw various terms like -- `PBKDF-2, salt, key pairs, hashing`. I never really understood what do they mean deeply.

5 years back, I got a chance to help freeCodeCamp in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/pull/184">creating a short course on public key cryptography</a> aimed at web developers.

That course gave me a chance to dive deep into these cryptography concepts.

So, I created this free course to share my learnings with all the developers curious to understand the <strong>cryptography concepts that are relevant to daily developer life.</strong>

**🟢 It's live on: https://cryptography-for-devs.github.io**

We have got some amazing feedback from [Cassidy Williams](https://x.com/cassidoo) and [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)!

It fills my heart with joy to receive feedback from people I have admired all along.

## Course contents

I have tried covering developer-oriented cryptography concepts in an easy to follow manner.

If the first half proves valuable to lots of developers, then I will work hard on the second half based on developers' feedback.

All of this will remain free, forever! <a href="https://twitter.com/vkwebdev" target="_blank">You can follow me on Twitter</a>, there you will receive updates on future releases and my future projects. no BS.

## Contributing

There are two ways to contribute that I feel are going to be impactful:

- Improve the existing course content by submitting a PR.
- Create an issue and introduce yourself in that issue, if you would like to help me write one of the future lessons.
