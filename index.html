        <h1>This is Curious Cryptography for Developers</h1>



        <p>In my initial days as a back-end developer, I saw and heard various words -- salt, cryptographic hash,
            symmetric keys, public key, private key, TLS and so on. I always had an urge to know what's going around but
            never did.</p>

        <p>Then 5 years back, I got a chance to help freeCodeCamp in <a target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/pull/184">creating a short course on public
                key
                cryptography</a>
            aimed at web developers.</p>

        <p>Over the time, I have realised that these concepts are kept hidden behind the curtains. But I believe there's
            many developers that might have the same urge to understand these cryptographic concepts.</p>

        <p>So, this course is for every curious developer who ever wondered what's going behind. Welcome!</p>
