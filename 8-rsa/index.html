        <h2>Diffie Hellman gets attacked with -- Man in the Middle!</h2>

        <p>
            We saw in the previous lesson that the Diffie Hellman key exchange allowed two parties to arrive at the same
            secret key that they could use as an encryption key to encrypt their communication.</p>

        <p>
            Diffie Hellman key exchange alone is not sufficient. It can be attacked with a man in the middle.
            Let us see what does that look like.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable src="mitm-1.png" alt="Man in the middle attack illustration">
            <figcaption>
                Step 1: Ant asking Bug to exchange a key.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Ant asks Bug to establish a secret key using Diffie Hellman.</p>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable src="mitm-2.png" alt="Man in the middle attack illustration">
            <figcaption>
                Step 2: Communication intercepted by man in the middle!
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The man in the middle, the attacker, intercepts the message and replies to Ant. Ant thinks the reply is from
            Bug!</p>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable src="mitm-3.png" alt="Man in the middle attack illustration">
            <figcaption>
                Step 3: Ant exchanges the key.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Ant thinks that he is talking to Bug.</p>

        <p>Ant has no way to know that their communication is being intercepted by an
            attacker.</p>

        <p>So, Ant exchanges a secret key using Diffie Hellman with the attacker who is impersonating to be Bug. They
            successfully exchange a secret key <strong>13</strong>!</p>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable src="mitm-4.png" alt="Man in the middle attack illustration">
            <figcaption>
                Step 4: Now, attacker exchanges a key with Bug.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Now, the attacker says to Bug, that he is "Ant" and then exchanges a secret key <strong>22</strong> with Bug.
        </p>

        <p>In Bug's mind it is Ant with whom he has exchanged the secret key. But in reality the attacker has
            impersonated as Ant!</p>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable src="mitm-5.png" alt="Man in the middle attack illustration">
            <figcaption>
                Step 5: Man in the middle alters the communication!
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p><strong>Mayday, mayday, mayday! We are under attack!</strong></p>

        <p>Now, Ant sends an encrypted message to Bug using secret key <strong>13</strong> because according to Ant this
            secret key <strong>13</strong> has been exchanged with Bug. But in reality its the attacker with whom he has
            exchanged the key!</p>

        <p>So, the attacker is able to decrypt Ant's message, <strong>modifies it</strong> and then encrypts it back
            with the secret key
            <strong>22</strong> he exchanged with Bug.
        </p>

        <p>When Bug receives this encrypted message, Bug thinks that its from Ant. But we know the reality. The attacker
            impersonated as Ant and exchanged the secret key.</p>

        <p>
            The attacker is able to decrypt and modify all messages
            between Ant and Bug without them realising this!
        </p>

        <p>Ant and Bug
            both think that they have exchanged a secret key with each other but in reality the
            attacker exchanged the secret key first with Ant and then another secret key with Bug. So, the attacker is
            able to decrypt and modify all communication
            between Ant and Bug as he has the secret keys!</p>

        <p><strong>This way our whole
                communication has got compromised!</strong></p>

        <p>
            The Diffie Hellman key exchange was indeed one of the greatest step forward in secure network communication.
            But using Diffie Hellman key exchange alone is prone to Man in the Middle attack.
        </p>

        <p>If there was a way for Ant to <strong>verify whether he is talking with Bug or with someone else</strong>
            then Man in the Middle can be stopped!</p>

        <h2>RSA quietly enters the room!</h2>

        <p>RSA is a public key encryption algorithm or asymmetric key encryption algorithm, both are
            same thing. RSA comes from the surnames of its inventors: Ron <b>R</b>ivest, Adi <b>S</b>hamir and Leonard
            <b>A</b>dleman. They were from MIT. Its
            inventors were greatly inspired by
            Diffie, Hellman and Merkle.
        </p>

        <p>In symmetric encryption we studied that it had one key that we used to encrypt, as well decrypt.</p>

        <p>In asymmetric key encryption algorithm like RSA, there are two keys. We call them as a key pair.</p>

        <p>Out of the two keys, one is called as a <strong>private key</strong> and other is called as a <strong>public
                key</strong>. The public key can be shared with everyone.</p>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable src="public-private.png"
                alt="illustration of a guy sharing public key but kept private key in brick vault">
            <figcaption>
                Public key is for public. Private key is private to you. Simple.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>But the private key is meant to be kept super secret! It <strong>MUST NEVER</strong> ever be revealed. As we
            will move forward
            you will realise whole lot of bad things happen if someone reveals their private key.</p>

        <p>The interesting thing about asymmetric key encryption is that -- if a message is encrypted with the public
            key then it can ONLY be decrypted with the corresponding private key. No other key in this universe can
            decrypt it.</p>

        <p>And it works the other way round too. If a message is encrypted with the private key then it can ONLY be
            decrypted using the corresponding public key.</p>

        <p>The two keys -- public and private keys are mathematically linked with each other. <strong>One encrypts, the
                other
                decrypts.</strong></p>

            <img data-zoomable src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/public_key.png"
                alt="XKCD comic illustrating cueball thinking to reveal his private key which MUST never be done in practice">
            <figcaption>
                NEVER EVER do the above!
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The above is from the popular xkcd comic, the character there (named Cueball) is thinking to reveal his
            private key. <strong>That's the worst thing</strong> you can do to your computer's (or server's) security.
            This is what
            happens when we don't understand basic cryptography :)</p>

        <h2>How RSA solves Man in the Middle...?</h2>

        <p>One of the main motivations behind the development of RSA algorithm
            was to be able to sign messages with a <strong>digital signature</strong>.</p>

        <p>Let us see how digital signature using RSA helps in making our Diffie Hellman immune to Man in the Middle
            attacks!</p>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable src="dh-rsa-1.png" alt="Diffie Hellman with RSA illustration">
            <figcaption>
                Step 1: Send <b>signed</b> values to Ant. Click image to enlarge.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>First, Bug generates his RSA key pair. He has distributed his public key to everybody and kept his private
            key
            just to himself.</p>

        <p>This means Ant and the attacker has access to Bug's RSA public key.</p>

        <p>Now Ant sends a message to Bug asking to start the Diffie Hellman key exchange process. Bug's computer
            generates
            <code>base, modulus and his secret number</code>, then it calculates
            <strong><code>(base<sup>bug's secret</sup> mod modulus)</code></strong> which comes out to be
            <code><strong><code>2<sup>15</sup> mod 19 = 12</code></strong>.</code>
        </p>

        <p>Then Bug creates a message that contains <code>base, modulus and 12</code> and then signs that message using
            his RSA private key.</p>

        <p><strong>But how does signing work?</strong></p>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable src="digital-sign-plus-verify.png"
                alt="Process of signing and verifying a RSA digital signature.">
            <figcaption>
                Process of signing and verifying a RSA digital signature. Click image to enlarge.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Signing a message is a two step process. We first hash the contents of the message, in our case contents of
            the message are
            <code>"2 19 12"</code>. Then the resulting hash value gets encrypted using Bug's RSA private key. The result
            of the encryption is the <strong>signature</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>Signature is inserted to the end of the message and
            sent to Ant.</p>

        <p>When Ant receives this signed message, he needs to <strong>verify whether the signature is valid or
                not</strong>.</p>

        <p>
            Ant verifies the signature in two steps. First, he calculates the hash of the message contents:
            <code>2 19 12</code>. Then signature is decrypted using Bug's public key, if the resulting value
            matches the hash value of the message contents then it means <strong>that the signature is
                verified!</strong>
        </p>

        <p>If the signature is verified then it proves <strong>two heavily important</strong> things -- </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>First: the message contents are not modified by a middle man</strong>.
                <br><br>
                During signature generation, Bug hashed the
                message contents <code>2 19 12</code> and encrypted this hash value. This encrypted hash value was sent
                as signature.
                <br><br>
                Now when
                we decrypt the signature, we get the hash value that Bug calculated. Hence, the
                <strong>decrypted signature represents the message contents as it was on Bug's side.</strong>
                <br><br>
                To verify, Ant again takes the message contents <code>2 19 12</code> and hashes it. If the hash value
                comes out to be same
                as the decrypted signature value then it means that we have received the message contents without any
                alteration!
                <br><br>
                Let us suppose message's content was modifed by a man in the middle. The attacker changed the message to
                <code>4 19 14</code>. When Ant will calculate the hash of this, its not going to match the decrypted
                signature value, which signals that the message contents are <strong>not same as how Bug wanted it to
                    be</strong> so
                signature verification fails!
                <br><br>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Second: the message was sent by Bug. Nobody else could have sent this message.</strong>
                <br><br>
                When the signature verification passed successfully this means that Ant was able to decrypt the
                signature perfectly fine with Bug's RSA public key.
                <br><br>
                If Ant was successfully able to decrypt the signature with Bug's public key this means that
                <strong>it could only have been encrypted with the corresponding private key.</strong> And only Bug has
                access to his private key. This means only Bug could have sent this signed message!
                <br><br>
                Now imagine, the man in the middle intercepts the message, changes the message contents, and calculates
                a new signature but with his
                own private key. This
                modified message with the attacker's
                signature
                gets forwarded to Ant.
                <br><br>
                Since this evil message's signature was created with the attacker's private key, it can only be
                decrypted using attacker's public key. <strong>It cannot be decrypted using Bug's public key.</strong>
                So, when we try to decrypt this signature using Bug's public key, the decryption fails and thus
                resulting in a signature verification failure!
                <br><br>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>So, when the signature verification passes ✅, it means that -- <strong>the message contents are not modified
                by a Man in the Middle. And
                the message came from Bug only.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Now the Man in the Middle (our attacker) <strong>will not</strong> be able to impersonate as Ant or Bug also
            the attacker
            <strong>cannot</strong> modify their
            messages. <strong>This defeats the Man in the Middle attack badly!</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Our RSA digital signature rocks! 🥂</p>
