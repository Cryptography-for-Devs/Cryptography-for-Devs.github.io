        <h2>The advent of GPUs</h2>

        <p>When Nvidia launched the world's first Graphics Processing Unit in 1999 -- GeForce 256, they set the stage
            for
            future growth of parallel processing.</p>

        <p>Post 2008 to today's 2020s, the processing capabilities of these GPUs have grown exponentially. Plus their
            cost
            have significantly decreased over time.</p>

        <p>Back in early 2000s, if one had to brute force a password, they would use a CPU which had a few cores.
            So, only a few parallel (password, hash) combinations could be calculated at a time.</p>

        <p>The modern GPUs have thousands of cores. If we take a look at Nvidia RTX 4090, it can calculate around
            <strong>19 billion SHA-256 hashes per
                second</strong>. Attackers realised this parallel processing power, they could now brute-force passwords
            at astonishingly
            fast rate!
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable src="power-of-gpus.svg" alt="The parallel processing power of GPUs!">
            <figcaption>The parallel processing power of GPUs!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            If the attacker has to crack a salted password, he takes the salt from the db, and
            then
            computes around <strong>100 - 150 billions of SHA-256(password + salt) combinations per second</strong>
            because attackers have
            multiple GPUs in their password cracking rig. In a few days, most of the passwords will be cracked
            except for the larger and complex ones like passwords that are greater than 8 characters.
        </p>

        <p>This is a <strong>serious security risk</strong>. If a hacker with 5 to 10 high-end GPUs can cause this much
            damage,
            imagine
            if a very well-funded
            entity like a large cyber terrorist group gets access of hundreds of powerful GPUs, the damage can be
            disastrous!
        </p>

        <h2>PBKDF-2!</h2>

        <p><strong>Password based key derivation function 2 (PBKDF-2)</strong> is a key derivation
            function designed for storing user passwords safely.</p>

        <p>A <strong>key derivation function (KDF)</strong> was made to derive one or more keys from a master key. The
            derived keys can differ in their key length. Many
            cryptographic
            protocols (like SSL / TLS) had a need to derive multiple keys from a single master key. So, that's how KDFs
            came to be.</p>

        <p>A KDF uses a
            <strong>psuedorandom
                function (PRF)</strong> internally to generate a new key when given the
            master key and a message
            as an input. Psuedorandom functions are somewhat similar to hash functions but with an important difference.
            A hash function behaves like:
        </p>

        <pre>
            sha-256("greatapples" + "salt") = 27f0f577ce740bc302eb8bf55faf293c15a2131c
        </pre>

        <p>
            In hash functions, <strong>there's no concept of key in it</strong>. This is the major difference
            between a hash function and a PRF.
            Hash functions were not designed for the use case of
            deriving keys from a master key.
        </p>

        <p>A psuedorandom function (PRF), takes in two inputs -- a key and a message, now based on the
            key and the message, it produces a fixed-length output key. With the master key as input, we can produce
            multiple different keys by
            providing different messages. The <strong>different keys will look so random</strong> that a third-party
            won't be able to
            tell that they are in someway derived from a single master key.</p>

        <p>
            Hash functions and psuedorandom functions share many important properties like producing random irreversible
            output and producing fixed-length output. The <strong>HMAC
                (hash
                based message authentication code)</strong> is one of the most widely used psuedorandom function.
        </p>

        <p>
            Internally the HMAC
            algorithm uses a cryptographically secure hash function like SHA-256. The HMAC algorithm accepts key and
            message as input, and very cleverly uses SHA-256 to produce an output. The HMAC algorithm is known as a
            <strong>keyed hash function</strong> -- it utilizes a hash function along with a key. Our HMAC uses
            SHA-256, so its called HMAC-SHA-256.
        </p>

        <pre>
            Let's imagine our master key is "staplehorse" and we want to derive 
            two keys from this master key.

            We will use a key derivation function which will 
            internally use HMAC-SHA-256 as its psuedorandom function.

            The first key we will use it as our database's password.
            The second key we will use for our PayPal account.


                master key     message    key length in bytes  
                    üëá           üëá          üëá
            KDF("staplehorse", "db password", 8) = 120d50e36d1f290c

            
                master key     message    key length in bytes  
                    üëá            üëá              üëá
            KDF("staplehorse", "paypal password", 18) = 9r0f50e46d2xc90ci8317fd38et2az23qw11

        </pre>

        <p>
            You will notice that the KDF produces different length keys. The KDF does this in the following manner:
        </p>

        <pre>
            Our above KDF used the HMAC-SHA-256. Since our HMAC uses SHA-256, 
            its hash output size is fixed at 256 bits (32 bytes).
        
            If the KDF receives output key byte size as less than 32 bytes, 
            for e.g. 18 bytes
            then the output of the HMAC-SHA-256 will get truncated from the end 
            to match the 18 byte key size.

            And if the requested key byte size is greater than 32 bytes, 
            for e.g. 40 bytes,
            then the HMAC-SHA-256 algorithm is repeated with a counter 
            added to the message that generates a completely
            different output. 
            Now, we use all the 32 bytes from the 
            first output and we use only the first 8 bytes of the second ouput. 
            We concatenate the two outputs and then return the final output of 40 bytes.
        </pre>



        <p>Let us do a quick recap. We have absorbed a LOT!</p>

        <p>
            A <strong>key derivation function uses a psuedorandom function</strong> to
            derive many keys
            from
            a master key. HMAC-SHA-256 is a psuedorandom function which internally uses SHA-256.</p>

        <p>Now, <strong>PBKDF-2</strong> is a key derivation function that is specifically designed for the use case of
            handling user
            passwords. It takes the <code>user's password, salt and iterations</code> as an input. If we don't provide
            the salt by ourselves, the algorithm generates a salt by its own. Then it passes the user's password and the
            salt to the underlying psuedorandom function. It's recommended to use HMAC-SHA-256 as the psuedorandom
            function for PBKDF-2.</p>

        <p>We told that PBKDF-2 accepted as an input <strong>iterations</strong>. Iterations is the
            number of times the input password and the salt goes through the underlying psuedorandom function. The
            current recommendation
            from <a
                href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pbkdf2">OWASP</a>
            is
            to keep 600,000 iterations. So, our psuedorandom function that is HMAC-SHA-256 will be run 600K times, and
            the last
            iteration's output
            will be the final received output to us. The number of iterations is said to be the <strong>work
                factor</strong> -- higher the number of iterations, more work is required to be done by the
            processor before giving the final output.
        </p>

        <pre>
            Let's look at the PBKDF-2 iterations. That is the 
            iterations of the underlying PRF, HMAC-SHA-256.
            
            Observe that the output of the previous iteration 
            gets sent to the input for the next iteration.

                            
                               key           message
            Iteration 1:       üëá              üëá
            HMAC-SHA-256("user-password", "long-salt") = 19b7567e3b20d50e3

                                key           message
            Iteration 2:        üëá              üëá
            HMAC-SHA-256("user-password", "19b7567e3b20d50e3") = 0c0a2b075d4025281

                                            
                                key           message
            Iteration 3:        üëá              üëá
            HMAC-SHA-256("user-password", "0c0a2b075d4025281") = 398200f9a7b2f7811

                                            
                                key           message
            Iteration 4:        üëá              üëá
            HMAC-SHA-256("user-password", "398200f9a7b2f7811") = 19b7567e3b20d50e3

                                    .                                   .
                                    .                                   .
                                    .                                   .
                                    .                                   .
        </pre>

        <p>Remember, we told you that you should never ever implement your own cryptographic algorithms. You should
            always use your framework's provided methods! Django provides a <code>User.objects.create_user()</code>
            method to create a user. Let's see how it will work
            under the hood.</p>

        <pre>
            User.objects.create_user("john", "lennon@thebeatles.com", "johnpassword")
            will create a user named "john", with the email "lennon@thebeatles.com"
            and password "johnpassword".

            The above password gets sent to the make_password() function which generates
            a salt and passes the password and salt to the pbkdf2 function which 
            uses HMAC-SHA-256 as its PRF.

            Django saves the password as a string to db in the following form:
            &lt;algorithm&gt;$&lt;iterations&gt;$&lt;salt&gt;$&lt;hash&gt;

            hash is the final output of PBKDF-2.

            An example password would be (added space between $ for readability):
            pbkdf2_sha256 $ 600000 $ BHz2LaFrMrXt $ VYlU5EBfFTqErm7fo/rjd67mMiYtmAdFoXDR7ueOUxM=
        </pre>

        <p>The 600K PBKDF-2's HMAC-SHA-256 iterations that we saw <strong>dramatically slows
                down</strong> the brute-force process for password crackers using GPUs.
        </p>

        <p>Let us take a situation where an attacker tries to brute-force a password using
            Nvidia RTX 4090. We will compare SHA-256 salted password hash vs PBKDF-2 derived key.</p>

        <pre>
        Let us assume we are cracking a 11 character password.
        The attacker as always has access to the salt. 
        He now just needs to brute-force all possible password combinations. 
        
        Let us assume our character set to be just 26 lowercase characters.
        Total possible password combinations will be 26 to the power 11: 
        26^11 = 3,670,344,486,987,776 possible password combinations.



        A NVIDIA RTX 4090 can calculate for SHA-256: 19 billion hashes per second
        
        Attacker will run:  sha-256("possible-password-1" + "the-salt")
                            sha-256("possible-password-2" + "the-salt")
                            sha-256("possible-password-3" + "the-salt") and so on...
        
        Time to crack for SHA-256 on NVIDIA RTX 4090: 
        3,670,344,486,987,776 √∑ 19 billion ‚âà 193,176 seconds ‚âà 2 days.



        A NVIDIA RTX 4090 can calculate for PBKDF2 (600K iterations): 14,000 hashes per second

        Attacker will run:  PBKDF-2("possible-password-1", "the-salt", 600000)
                            PBKDF-2("possible-password-2", "the-salt", 600000)
                            PBKDF-2("possible-password-3", "the-salt", 600000) and so on...

        Time to crack for PBKDF2 (600K iterations): 
        3,670,344,486,987,776 √∑ 14000
        ‚âà 2.6 * 10^11 seconds
        ‚âà 8,245 years!
    </pre>

        <p>To crack <code>greatapples</code> if we just used SHA-256 hashing, attacker could crack it in around 2 days.
            But with PBKDF-2, it'll take 8,245 years. That's the power of PBKDF-2. So, PBKDF-2 ultimately helped us
            <strong>defend against powerful GPU-based
                brute-force attacks!</strong>
