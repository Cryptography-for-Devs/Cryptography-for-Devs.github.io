        <h2>Passwords</h2>

            <figcaption>Wikipedia's login screen</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>In the early 1990s, Internet started taking off, lots of companies started launching their products on the
            World
            Wide Web. People started signing up on these new platforms with their username and password.</p>

        <figure>
            <img data-zoomable src="hacked-db.svg" alt="hacked db illustration">
            <figcaption>A compromised database</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>In those days, database breaches via SQL injection attacks were common, it often <strong>revealed users'
                usernames
                and
                passwords</strong> to
            the hacker.</p>

        <p>And if a user's username and password is revealed then there's a great chance that the user had used the same
            username and password for other sites, so, basically the hacker got access to users' multiple accounts. This
            was
            an extremely serious concern.</p>

        <p>How can we <strong>not reveal a user's password</strong> to the hacker even if he has unauthorized access to
            the
            database? Any
            guesses?</p>

        <h2>Not revealing the password</h2>

        <p>Here's the problem that we are going to brainstorm on --</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We don't want to store the user's actual password on the database (referred to as <b>cleartext
                    or
                    plaintext password</b>). So that even if the hacker has unauthorized access to the database, he
                can't access the user's passwords.</li>
            <li>For login to work, there must be a way through which we can make sure that the user entered the correct
                password.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We have learned about symmetric key encryption. It's a great way to hide information. So, what if we, take
            the
            user's password, encrypt it using a secure encryption algorithm and store the encrypted value (ciphertext)
            on
            the
            database not the user's actual password.
        </p>

        <p>When user needs to login, they enter their password, we'll encrypt it
            again with the same algorithm and
            the same key. So, if the user entered the same password as he had set, the encrypted value will come out
            same as
            before and login will be successful.</p>

        <p>Our stated problem is solved! We are not revealing the
            user's password. Login is working fine as well. Anything wrong with the above approach? ü§î</p>

        <p>If you look closely, <strong>we will need to store the encryption
                key</strong> because without the key we won't be able to carry out the encryption process during future
            logins to check if the password is correct.</p>

        <p>We will store the key in may be a different database, right? Now, this new database full of user passwords'
            <strong>encryption keys is the
                only thing a competent
                hacker needs access to and all of the users' account will be in his control!</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            We cannot assume that the attacker won't ever be able to breach our database containing encryption keys. We
            want to
            solve the problem that even if the database gets breached, we don't want the attacker get access to the
            passwords. But in this case,
            if the attacker is successful in breaching the database containing encryption keys, he will be able to decrypt all user
            passwords. That way, all passwords will get revealed in their original cleartext form!
        </p>

        <p>Now you see, why encryption is not the right solution. Pause a bit and think if you have any other ideas to
            solve
            this?</p>

        <h2>Hash the passwords!</h2>

            <img data-zoomable src="i-want-passwords.svg" alt="password hashing in the db illustration">
            <figcaption>Attacker unable to access cleartext passwords because of hash</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>We have learned that hashing is a <b>one-way function</b>. Once we hash an input, we cannot derive the input
            from
            the hash value. So if we hash the users' password and store the hash on the database, then even if our
            database
            is compromised, the hacker won't be able to figure out the actual password. He will just see the hashes.</p>

                zoom.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Now, when the user requests to login, we can hash their entered password, if the output hash
            comes to out be same as the stored hash, it means the user has entered the correct password.</p>

        <p>Hashing the password doesn't reveal the user's password and login works out well. And the hacker cannot
            figure
            out the passwords from the hashes. Remember, hashing is a one-way function? ;) We have finally solved our
            quest!
        </p>

        <p>Umm, the bad guys keep on growing their arsenal, <strong>they have some plans to attack us</strong>, let's
            face
            them in the next
            lesson!</p>
